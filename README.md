# CycleSharing_Website

This is a website made for our campus student to share cycle with each other

The main server file is "server.js"

After running the server file by giving command as "nodemon server.js", It will provide you the http address which you can use to search the website on browser and you can also share this address to some other user if he/she is using the same wifi as yours.
